# Bibledit for Android

## Developer information

To get a shell on the device: $ adb shell

To view the logbook from within the shell on the device: $ logcat

## Dependencies

Native dependencies are in folder "sqlite" and can be built from there.

## libbibledit

Script "native" builds libbibledit.a.

## Repository

Recommended is to copy the source outside of the git repository before building.
This leaves the repository uncluttered.
Use script "copy" for that.
