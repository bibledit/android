This is no longer in use.


jQuery Mobile
This library was tried.
It looked good at first.
But it interferes with the base URL, so that page forwarding through status code 302 fails to work.

jquery.mobile-1.4.5-touch
This folder contains a version of jQuery Mobile that was created through the download builder at http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder. Only the Touch Event was included, plus any dependencies that the download builder selects to include as well.
After upgrading to jQuery 3.1, it appears that jQuery Mobile 1.4.5 does not yet work with this version. Instead TouchSwipe was used.
