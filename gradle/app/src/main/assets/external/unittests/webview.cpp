/*

 This filter was originally intended to find out when to downgrade the visual Bible editors.
 It was supposed to downgrade it when the browser's user agent met certain criteria.
 
 Some of the browsers were tested:
 
 Ubuntu 14.04 AppleWebKit/538.15
 Ubuntu 15.04 AppleWebKit/601.1
 Ubuntu 16.04 AppleWebKit/603.1
 Ubuntu 16.10 AppleWebKit/603.1

 Nexus 6 AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/56.0.2924 Safari/537.36

 Mac Google Chrome: AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36

 Android Internet Device (Android 4.1): Android 4.1.1 AppleWebKit/534 Safari/534.30
 
 On the Genymotion emulator, Android 4.4, it works fine there.

 So it appears that it is hard to decide to downgrade based on the user agent.
