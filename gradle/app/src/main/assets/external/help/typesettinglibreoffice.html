<h1>translate("Typesetting in LibreOffice")</h1>

<h2>translate("Introduction")</h2>
<p>translate("See the online help about typesetting for more information about some general principles.")</p>
<p>translate("You have access to a copy of LibreOffice.")</p>

<h2>translate("Page count")</h2>
<p>translate("The publisher may set limits to the number of pages the typeset Bible may contain.")</p>
<p>translate("In this example, we expect an entire Bible, with singable Psalms added as an appendix, to contain no more than 2000 pages. Normal range is 1500 to 1800 pages.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("We suppose that the singable Psalms take up no more than 200 pages.")</p>
<p>translate("Usually the inclusion of the singable Psalms in a Bible will add about 10 percent to the number of pages.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("The Bible will have footnotes and crossreferences, all lumped together into a single textframe at the bottom of each page.")</p>
<p>translate("Let us now measure how many pages the notes are likely to take up.")</p>
<p>translate("Download the file with notes. It was exported above. It is called 00_Bible_notes.odt.")</p>
<p>translate("Open the file in LibreOffice.")</p>
<p>translate("Let it repaginate. A good way of doing this is to press Ctrl-P as if going to print the document. Then it will repaginate. Cancel the print dialog.")</p>
<p>translate("It will now give the page count that the notes are likely to take up.")</p>
<p>translate("In our case, this is about 300 pages.")</p>
<p>translate("Each chapter has headings. These headings do not belong to the notes. Thus the page count is too high.")</p>
<p>translate("Notice that the paragraph style for these headings is called 'Heading 1'.")</p>
<p>translate("Hide the headings. This can be done like this. Right-click on a heading. Choose 'Edit Paragraph Style'. A dialog comes up. Choose tab 'Font Effects'. Tick option 'Hidden'.")</p>
<p>translate("Repaginate, and notice the page count. In our case it is down to about 125.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("Let us now find out how many pages the main text body is likely to take up.")</p>
<p>translate("Download the OpenDocument file with text and note citations. It was exported above. It is called 00_Bible_text_and_note_citations.odt.")</p>
<p>translate("The document has only one column.")</p>
<p>translate("Repaginate and notice the page count. In our case this is 1750.")</p>
<p>translate("This is not accurate since it applies to a column count of one rather than two.")</p>
<p>translate("Set the whole document to have two columns.")</p>
<p>translate("Go to menu Format / Page. Choose the Columns tab. Choose two columns. Set the spacing to 0.2 cm. Set a thin separator line. Click Ok.")</p>
<p>translate("Repaginate and notice the page count. It is down to 1520.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("The font is of particular influence on the page count. This is not dealt with here.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("We are now able to estimate the page count for the entire Bible:")</p>
<p>translate("Text body 1520 pages. Notes 125 pages. Singable Psalms 200 pages. Estimated total is 1845 pages.")</p>

<h2>translate("Using LibreOffice for typesetting")</h2>
<p>translate("Having used LibreOffice for typesetting for some time, my experience is that the program is suitable for typesetting Bibles.")</p>
<p>translate("I'd like to give some hints about how to do typographic work in LibreOffice.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("To meet the requirement that line spacing be consistent throughout and be placed line on line across all pages, do the following:")</p>
<p>translate("Go to menu Format / Page, and enable Register-true. Set the reference style to 'Text Body'. Press OK.")</p>
<p>translate("Select all the text, and go to menu Format / Paragraph, and activate Register-true. Press OK.")</p>
<p>translate("The line spacing specified by the paragraph style 'Text Body' is now used as the reference line spacing for all paragraphs that have the register-true feature enabled.")</p>
<p>translate("The line spacing in the document is going to be consistent. It will be equal to the line spacing of the reference style 'Text Body', or a multiple of it.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("Changing the line spacing.")</p>
<p>translate("Change the line spacing in paragraph style 'Text Body'.")</p>
<p>translate("Press F11 to get the Styles and Formatting dialog.")</p>
<p>translate("Locate style 'Text Body'.")</p>
<p>translate("Right-click it with the mouse, and choose menu Modify.")</p>
<p>translate("Go to tab Indents & Spacing.")</p>
<p>translate("Adjust the spacing above the paragraph, the spacing below the paragrap, and the line spacing. Press OK.")</p>
<p>translate("It may happen that some paragraphs in the text used to have a line spacing equal to the line spacing of style 'Text Body', but now suddenly take up a multiple of it. This may happen when you have tightened the line spacing a bit.")</p>
<p>translate("To resolve this, make the line spacing of those paragraphs smaller than the line spacing of style 'Text body'.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("Updating a paragraph style.")</p>
<p>translate("After exporting USFM text to OpenDocument, the paragraph styles of the USFM document appear in LibreOffice.")</p>
<p>translate("For example, normal paragraphs usually have style 'p', and section heading 's'.")</p>
<p>translate("If you like to update a paragraph style, you may update each section heading individually, but this is a lot of work. It is faster to update the style for 's', so that this updates all paragraphs that have this style.")</p>
<p>translate("To update a paragraph style, right-click the text of this paragraph, and choose menu Edit Paragraph Style..., and make the desired settings.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("Exporting to PDF.")</p>
<p>translate("See menu File / Export as PDF.")</p>
<br>
<p>translate("Hiding the soft hyphens and non-breaking spaces.")</p>
<p>translate("The soft hyphens and the non-breaking spaces are visible as grey fields that clutter the page. To hide them, do this:")</p>
<p>translate("Go to menu Tools / Options.")</p>
<p>translate("Go to LibreOffice Writer / Formatting Aids.")</p>
<p>translate("Untick display of custom hyphens.")</p>
<p>translate("Untick display of non-breaking spaces.")</p>
