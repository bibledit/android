Release notes for Strong's Greek Dictionary in XML
By Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen

Version 1.55 (2012-07-18)
========================

- Fixed spelling of 'scupltured' --> 'sculptured' in 5480.


Version 1.5 (2011-09-26)
========================

- Now entries with 'of uncertain affinity' as the derivation have a
  correct split between <strongs_derivation>of uncertain
  affinity;</strongs_derivation> and the real definition.  Before, the
  definition would be included in the derivation as well.

- Fixed derivation of 5043 to be from 5088, not 5098.

- Various other fixes to either spellings or derivations.


Version 1.4 (2007-09-14)
========================

- Changed the Greek of a 26 entries, to be in conformance with the
  printed edition: 234, 493, 527, 703, 902, 965, 993, 1361, 1420,
  1502, 1503, 1541, 1695, 2216, 2256, 2636, 2810, 3103, 3116, 3138,
  3198, 4609, 4770, 4949, 5253, 5592.

- Moved some words between the various parts (i.e., derivation;
  definition; KJV-definition), to where they belong logically.

- Added some missing derivations.

- Fixed a lot of typos in the text.


Version 1.3 (2007-05-29)
========================

- Changed the Greek of about half a dozen entries, to be in
  conformance with the printed version.

  attribute "translit".
