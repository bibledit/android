\mt1 THE WISDOM OF JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH, 
\mt2 OR 
\mt1 ECCLESIASTICUS 
\ip \bk The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach\bk*, also called \bk Ecclesiasticus\bk*, is recognized as Deuterocanonical Scripture by the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox Churches. 
\is1 The Prologue of the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach. 
\ip WHEREAS many and great things have been delivered to us by the law and the prophets, and by the others that have followed in their steps, for which we must give Israel the praise for instruction and wisdom; and since not only the readers need to become skillful themselves, but also those who love learning must be able to profit those who are outside, both by speaking and writing; my grandfather Jesus, having much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets, and the other books of our fathers, and having gained great familiarity with them, was also drawn on himself to write somewhat pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that those who love learning, and are devoted to these things, might make progress much more by living according to the law. You are entreated therefore to read with favor and attention, and to pardon us, if in any parts of what we have labored to interpret, we may seem to fail in some of the phrases. For things originally spoken in Hebrew don’t have the same force in them when they are translated into another language. Not only these, but the law itself, and the prophecies, and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their original language. For having come into Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of Energetes the king, and having continued there some time, I found a copy giving no small instruction. I thought it therefore most necessary for me to apply some diligence and travail to translate this book, applying indeed much watchfulness and skill in that space of time to bring the book to an end and publish for them also, who in the land of their travels are desiring to learn, preparing their character in advance, so as to live according to the law.

\v 1 All wisdom comes from the Lord, 
\q2 and is with him forever. 
\q1
\v 2 Who can count the sand of the seas, 
\q2 the drops of rain, 
\q2 and the days of eternity? 
\q1
\v 3 Who will search out the height of the sky, 
\q2 the breadth of the earth, the deep, 
\q2 and wisdom? 
\q1
\v 4 Wisdom has been created before all things, 
\q2 and the understanding of prudence from everlasting. 
\v 5  \f + \fr 1:5  \ft Verse 5 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa The source of wisdom is God's word in the highest heaven, and her ways are the eternal commandments.\f* 
\q1
\v 6 To whom has the root of wisdom been revealed? 
\q2 Who has known her shrewd counsels? 
\v 7  \f + \fr 1:7  \ft Verse 7 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa To whom was the knowledge of wisdom manifested? Who has understood her abundant experience?\f* 
\q1
\v 8 There is one wise, greatly to be feared, 
\q2 sitting upon his throne: the Lord. 
\q1
\v 9 He created her. 
\q2 He saw and measured her. 
\q2 He poured her out upon all his works. 
\q1
\v 10  She is with all flesh according to his gift. 
\q2 He gave her freely to those who love him. 
\q1
\v 11 The fear of the Lord is glory, exultation, 
\q2 and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing. 
\q1
\v 12 The fear of the Lord will delight the heart, 
\q2 and will give gladness, joy, and length of days. 
\q1
\v 13 Whoever fears the Lord, it will go well with him at the last. 
\q2 He will be blessed in the day of his death . 
\q1
\v 14 To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. 
\q2 It was created together with the faithful in the womb. 
\q1
\v 15 She \f + \fr 1:15  \ft Gr. \fqa nested. \f* laid an eternal foundation with men. 
\q2 She will be trusted among their offspring. 
\q1
\v 16 To fear the Lord is the fullness of wisdom. 
\q2 She inebriates men with her fruits. 
\q1
\v 17 She will fill all her house with desirable things, 
\q2 and her storehouses with her produce. 
\q1
\v 18 The fear of the Lord is the crown of wisdom, 
\q2 making peace and \f + \fr 1:18  \ft Gr. \fqa health of cure. \f* perfect health to flourish. \f + \fr 1:18  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa Both are gifts of God for peace; glory opens out for those who love him. He saw her and took her measure.\f* 
\q1
\v 19 He both saw and measured her. 
\q2 He rained down skill and knowledge of understanding, 
\q2 and exalted the honor of those who hold her fast. 
\q1
\v 20 To fear the Lord is the root of wisdom. 
\q2 Her branches are length of days. 
\v 21  \f + \fr 1:21  \ft Verse 21 is omitted by the best authorities: \fqa The fear of the Lord drives away sins. Where it resides, it will turn away all anger. \f* 
\b
\q1
\v 22 Unjust wrath can never be justified, 
\q2 for the sway of his wrath is his downfall. 
\q1
\v 23 A man that is patient will resist for a season, 
\q2 and afterward gladness will spring up to him. 
\q1
\v 24 He will hide his words for a season, 
\q2 and the lips of many will tell of his understanding. 
\q1
\v 25 A parable of knowledge is in the treasures of wisdom; 
\q2 but godliness is an abomination to a sinner. 
\q1
\v 26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments 
\q2 and the Lord will give her to you freely; 
\q1
\v 27 for the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction. 
\q2 Faith and humility are his good pleasure. 
\q1
\v 28 Don’t disobey the fear of the Lord. 
\q2 Don’t come to him with a double heart. 
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be a hypocrite in the mouths of men. 
\q2 Keep watch over your lips. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t exalt yourself, 
\q2 lest you fall and bring dishonor upon your soul. 
\q1 The Lord will reveal your secrets 
\q2 and will cast you down in the midst of the congregation, 
\q2 because you didn’t come to the fear of the Lord 
\q2 and your heart was full of deceit. 
\b
\c  2  
\q1
\v 1 My son, if you come to serve the Lord, 
\q2 prepare your soul for temptation. 
\q1
\v 2 Set your heart aright, constantly endure, 
\q2 and don’t make haste in time of calamity. 
\q1
\v 3 Cling to him, and don’t depart, 
\q2 that you may be increased at your latter end. 
\q1
\v 4 Accept whatever is brought upon you, 
\q2 and be patient when you suffer humiliation. 
\q1
\v 5 For gold is tried in the fire, 
\q2 and acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. 
\q1
\v 6 Put your trust in him, and he will help you. 
\q2 Make your ways straight, and set your hope on him. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 All you who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy. 
\q2 Don’t turn aside, lest you fall. 
\q1
\v 8 All you who fear the Lord, put your trust in him, 
\q2 and your reward will not fail. 
\q1
\v 9 All you who fear the Lord, hope for good things, 
\q2 and for eternal gladness and mercy. 
\q1
\v 10 Look at the generations of old, and see: 
\q2 Who ever put his trust in the Lord, and was ashamed? 
\q2 Or who remained in his fear, and was forsaken? 
\q2 Or who called upon him, and he despised him? 
\q1
\v 11 For the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. 
\q2 He forgives sins and saves in time of affliction. 
\b
\q1
\v 12 Woe to fearful hearts, to faint hands, 
\q2 and to the sinner that goes two ways! 
\q1
\v 13 Woe to the faint heart! For it doesn’t believe. 
\q2 Therefore it won’t be defended. 
\q1
\v 14 Woe to you who have lost your patience! 
\q2 And what will you all do when the Lord visits you? 
\q1
\v 15 Those who fear the Lord will not disobey his words. 
\q2 Those who love him will keep his ways. 
\q1
\v 16 Those who fear the Lord will seek his good pleasure. 
\q2 Those who love him will be filled with the law. 
\q1
\v 17 Those who fear the Lord will prepare their hearts, 
\q2 and will humble their souls in his sight. 
\q1
\v 18 We will fall into the hands of the Lord, 
\q2 and not into the hands of men; 
\q1 for as his majesty is, 
\q2 so also is his mercy. 
\b
\c  3  
\q1
\v 1 Hear me, your father, O my children, 
\q2 and do what you hear, that you all may be saved. 
\q1
\v 2 For the Lord has given the father glory concerning the children, 
\q2 and has confirmed the judgement of the mother concerning the sons. 
\q1
\v 3 He who honors his father will make atonement for sins. 
\q2
\v 4 He that gives glory to his mother is as one who lays up treasure. 
\q1
\v 5 Whoever honors his father will have joy in his own children. 
\q2 He will be heard in the day of his prayer. 
\q1
\v 6 He who gives glory to his father will have length of days. 
\q2 He who listens to the Lord will bring rest to his mother, 
\q1
\v 7  \f + \fr 3:7  \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa those who fear the Lord honor their father,\f* and will serve under his parents, as to masters. 
\q1
\v 8 Honor your father in deed and word, 
\q2 that a blessing may come upon you from him. 
\q1
\v 9 For the blessing of the father establishes the houses of children, 
\q2 but the curse of the mother roots out the foundations. 
\b
\q1
\v 10 Don’t glorify yourself in the dishonor of your father, 
\q2 for your father’s dishonor is no glory to you. 
\q1
\v 11 For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father, 
\q2 and a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children. 
\q1
\v 12 My son, help your father in his old age, 
\q2 and don’t grieve him as long as he lives. 
\q1
\v 13 If he fails in understanding, have patience with him. 
\q2 Don’t dishonor him in your full strength. 
\q1
\v 14 For the relieving of your father will not be forgotten. 
\q2 Instead of sins it will be added to build you up. 
\q1
\v 15 In the day of your affliction it will remember you, 
\q2 as fair weather upon ice, 
\q2 ao will your sins also melt away. 
\q1
\v 16 He who forsakes his father is as a blasphemer. 
\q2 He who provokes his mother is cursed by the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 17 My son, go on with your business in humility; 
\q2 so will you be loved by an acceptable man. 
\q1
\v 18 The greater you are, humble yourself the more, 
\q2 and you will find favor before the Lord. 
\v 19  \f + \fr 3:19  \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa Many are lofty and renowned, but he reveals his secrets to the humble.\f* 
\q1
\v 20 For the power of the Lord is great, 
\q2 and he is glorified by those who are lowly. 
\q1
\v 21 Don’t seek things that are too hard for you, 
\q2 and don’t search out things that are above your strength. 
\q1
\v 22 Think about the things that have been commanded you, 
\q2 for you have no need of the things that are secret. 
\q1
\v 23 Don’t be overly busy in your superfluous works, 
\q2 for more things are showed to you than men can understand. 
\q1
\v 24 For the conceit of many has led them astray. 
\q2 Evil opinion has caused their judgement to slip. 
\q1
\v 25  \f + \fr 3:25  \ft Some manuscripts omit verse 25.\f*There is no light without eyes. 
\q2 There is no wisdom without knowledge. 
\b
\q1
\v 26 A stubborn heart will do badly at the end. 
\q2 He who loves danger will perish in it. 
\q1
\v 27 A stubborn heart will be burdened with troubles. 
\q2 The sinner will heap sin upon sins. 
\q1
\v 28 The calamity of the proud is no healing, 
\q2 for a weed of wickedness has taken root in him. 
\q1
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will understand a parable. 
\q2 A wise man desires the ear of a listener. 
\q1
\v 30 Water will quench a flaming fire; 
\q2 almsgiving will make atonement for sins. 
\q1
\v 31 He repays good turns is mindful of that which comes afterward. 
\q2 In the time of his falling he will find a support. 
\b
\c  4  
\q1
\v 1 My son, don’t deprive the poor of his living. 
\q2 Don’t make the needy eyes wait long. 
\q1
\v 2 Don’t make a hungry soul sorrowful, 
\q2 or provoke a man in his distress. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t add more trouble to a heart that is provoked. 
\q2 Don’t put off giving to him who is in need. 
\q1
\v 4 Don’t reject a suppliant in his affliction. 
\q2 Don’t turn your face away from a poor man. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t turn your eye away from one who asks. 
\q2 Give no occasion to a man to curse you. 
\q1
\v 6 For if he curses you in the bitterness of his soul, 
\q2 he who made him will hear his supplication. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Endear yourself to the assembly. 
\q2 Bow your head to a great man. 
\q1
\v 8 Incline your ear to a poor man. 
\q2 Answer him with peaceful words in humility. 
\q1
\v 9 Deliver him who is wronged from the hand of him that wrongs him; 
\q2 Don’t be faint-hearted in giving judgement. 
\q1
\v 10 Be as a father to the fatherless, 
\q2 and like a husband to their mother. 
\q1 So you will be as a son of the Most High, 
\q2 and he will love you more than your mother does. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom exalts her sons, 
\q2 and takes hold of those who seek her. 
\q1
\v 12 He who loves her loves life. 
\q2 Those who seek to her early will be filled with gladness. 
\q1
\v 13 He who holds her fast will inherit glory. 
\q2 Where \f + \fr 4:13  \ft Or, \fqa she \f* he enters, the Lord will bless. 
\q1
\v 14 Those who serve her minister to the Holy One. 
\q2 The Lord loves those who love her. 
\q1
\v 15 He who gives ear to her will judge the nations. 
\q2 He who heeds her will dwell securely. 
\q1
\v 16 If he trusts her, he will inherit her, 
\q2 and his generations will possess her. 
\q1
\v 17 For at the first she will walk with him in crooked ways, 
\q2 and will bring fear and dread upon him, 
\q2 and torment him with her discipline, 
\q2 until she may trust his soul, and try him by her judgments. 
\q1
\v 18 Then she will return him again to the straight way, 
\q2 and will gladden him, and reveal to him her secrets. 
\q1
\v 19 If he goes astray, she will forsake him, 
\q2 and hand him over to his fall. 
\b
\q1
\v 20 Observe the opportunity, and beware of evil. 
\q2 Don’t be ashamed of your soul. 
\q1
\v 21 For there is a shame that brings sin, 
\q2 and there is a shame that is glory and grace. 
\q1
\v 22 Don’t show partiality against your soul. 
\q2 Don’t revere any man to your falling. 
\q1
\v 23 Don’t refrain from speaking when it is for safety. 
\q2 \f + \fr 4:23  \ft Some manuscripts omit this line. \f*Don’t hide your wisdom for the sake of seeming fair. 
\q1
\v 24 For wisdom will be known by speech, 
\q2 and instruction by the word of the tongue. 
\q1
\v 25 Don’t speak against the truth 
\q1 and be shamed for your ignorance. 
\q1
\v 26 Don’t be ashamed to confess your sins. 
\q2 Don’t fight the river’s current. 
\q1
\v 27 Don’t lay yourself down for a fool to tread upon. 
\q2 Don’t be partial to one that is mighty. 
\q1
\v 28 Strive for the truth to death, 
\q2 and the Lord God will fight for you. 
\b
\q1
\v 29 Don’t be rough hasty with your tongue, 
\q2 or slack and negligent in your deeds. 
\q1
\v 30 Don’t be like a lion in your house, 
\q2 or suspicious of your servants. 
\q1
\v 31 Don’t let your hand be stretched out to receive, 
\q2 and closed when you should repay. 
\c 5  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t set your heart upon your goods. 
\q2 Don’t say, “They are sufficient for me.” 
\q1
\v 2 Don’t follow your own mind and your strength 
\q2 to walk in the desires of your heart. 
\q1
\v 3 Don’t say, “Who will have dominion over me?” 
\q2 for the Lord will surely take vengeance on you. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Don’t say, “I sinned, and what happened to me?” 
\q2 for the Lord is patient. 
\q1
\v 5 Don’t be so confident of atonement 
\q2 that you add sin upon sins. 
\q1
\v 6 Don’t say, “His compassion is great. 
\q2 He will be pacified for the multitude of my sins,” 
\q2 for mercy and wrath are with him, 
\q2 and his indignation will rest on sinners. 
\q1
\v 7 Don’t wait to turn to the Lord. 
\q2 Don’t put off from day to day; 
\q2 for suddenly the wrath of the Lord will come on you, 
\q2 and you will perish in the time of vengeance. 
\b
\q1
\v 8 Don’t set your heart upon unrighteous gains, 
\q2 for you will profit nothing in the day of calamity. 
\q1
\v 9 Don’t winnow with every wind. 
\q2 Don’t walk in every path. 
\q2 This is what the sinner who has a double tongue does. 
\q1
\v 10 Be steadfast in your understanding. 
\q2 Let your speech be consistent. 
\b
\q1
\v 11 Be swift to hear 
\q2 and answer with patience. 
\q1
\v 12 If you have understanding, answer your neighbor; 
\q2 but if not, put your hand over your mouth. 
\q1
\v 13 Glory and dishonor is in talk. 
\q2 A man’s tongue may be his downfall. 
\q1
\v 14 Don’t be called a whisperer. 
\q2 Don’t lie in wait with your tongue; 
\q2 for shame is on the thief, 
\q2 and an evil condemnation is on him who has a double tongue. 
\q1
\v 15 Don’t be ignorant in a great and small matters. 
\c 6  
\q1
\v 1 Don’t become an enemy instead of a friend; 
\q2 for an evil name will inherit shame and reproach. 
\q2 So it is with the sinner who has a double tongue. 
\b
\q1
\v 2 Don’t exalt yourself in the counsel of your soul, 
\q2 that your soul be not torn in pieces as a bull. 
\q1
\v 3 You will eat up your leaves, destroy your fruit, 
\q2 and leave yourself as a dry tree. 
\q1
\v 4 A wicked soul will destroy him who has it, 
\q2 and will make him a laughing stock to his enemies. 
\b
\q1
\v 5 Sweet words will multiply a man’s friends. 
\q2 A gracious tongue will multiply courtesies. 
\q1
\v 6 Let those that are at peace with you be many, 
\q2 but your advisers one of a thousand. 
\q1
\v 7 If you want to gain a friend, get him in a time of testing, 
\q2 and don’t be in a hurry to trust him. 
\q1
\v 8 For there is a friend just for an occasion. 
\q2 He won’t continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q1
\v 9 And there is a friend who turns into an enemy. 
\q2 He will discover strife to your reproach. 
\q1
\v 10 And there is a friend who is a companion at the table, 
\q2 but he won’t continue in the day of your affliction. 
\q1
\v 11 In your prosperity he will be as yourself, 
\q2 and will be bold over your servants. 
\q1
\v 12 If you are brought low, he will be against you, 
\q2 and will hide himself from your face. 
\q1
\v 13 Separate yourself from your enemies, 
\q2 and beware of your friends. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 A faithful friend is a strong defense. 
\q2 He who has found him has found a treasure. 
\q1
\v 15 There is nothing that can be taken in exchange for a faithful friend. 
\q2 His excellency is beyond price. 
\q1
\v 16 A faithful friend is a life-saving medicine. 
\q2 Those who fear the Lord will find him. 
\q1
\v 17 He who fears the Lord directs his friendship properly; 
\q2 for as he is, so is his neighbor also. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 My son, gather instruction from your youth up. 
\q2 Even when you have gray hair you will find wisdom. 
\q1
\v 19 Come to her as one who plows and sows 
\q2 and wait for her good fruit; 
\q1 for your toil will be little in her tillage, 
\q2 and you will soon eat of her fruit. 
\q1
\v 20 How exceedingly harsh she is to the unlearned! 
\q2 He who is without understanding will not remain in her. 
\q1
\v 21 She will rest upon him as a mighty stone of trial. 
\q2 He won’t hesitate to cast her from him. 
\q1
\v 22 For wisdom is according to her name. 
\q1 She isn’t manifest to many. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Give ear, my son, and accept my judgement. 
\q2 Don’t refuse my counsel. 
\q1
\v 24 Bring your feet into her fetters, 
\q2 and your neck into her chain. 
\q1
\v 25 Put your shoulder under her and bear her. 
\q2 Don’t be grieved with her bonds. 
\q1
\v 26 Come to her with all your soul. 
\q2 Keep her ways with your whole power. 
\q1
\v 27 Search and seek, and she will be made known to you. 
\q2 When you get hold of her, don’t let her go. 
\q1
\v 28 For at the last you will find her rest; 
\q2 and she will be turned for you into gladness. 
\q1
\v 29 Her fetters will be to you for a covering of strength, 
\q2 and her chains for a robe of glory. 
\q1
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament upon her, 
\q2 and her bands are \x + \xo 6:30  \xt Numbers 15:38\x* a blue ribbon. 
\q1
\v 31 You shall put her on as a robe of glory, 
\q2 and shall put her on as a crown of rejoicing. 
\b
\q1
\v 32 My son, if you are willing, you will be instructed. 
\q2 If you will yield your soul, you will be prudent. 
\q1
\v 33 If you love to hear, you will receive. 
\q2 If you incline your ear, you will be wise. 
\q1
\v 34 Stand in the multitude of the elders. 
\q2 Attach yourself to whoever is wise. 
\q1
\v 35 Be willing to listen to every godly discourse. 
\q2 Don’t let the proverbs of understanding escape you. 
\q1
\v 36 If you see a man of understanding, get to him early. 
\q2 Let your foot wear out the steps of his doors. 
\q1
\v 37 Let your mind dwell on the ordinances of the Lord 
\q2 and meditate continually on his commandments. 
\q1 He will establish your heart 
\q2 and your desire for wisdom will be given to you. 
\b
\c  7  
\q1
\v 1 Do no evil, 
\q2 so will no evil overtake you. 
\q1
\v 2 Depart from wrong,

\v 12 Don’t say you, It is he that caused me to err; 
\q1 For he has no need of a sinful man. 
\q1
\v 13 The Lord hates every abomination; 
\q1 And those who fear him love it not. 
\q1
\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning, 
\q1 And left him in the hand of his own counsel. 
\q1
\v 15 If you will, you shall keep the commandments; 
\q1 And to perform faithfulness is of \add your own \add* good pleasure. 
\q1
\v 16 He has set fire and water before you: 
\q1 You will stretch forth your hand to whichever you will. 
\q1
\v 17 Before man is life and death;

\q1
\v 18 For great is the wisdom of the Lord:

\v 19 And his eyes are upon those who fear him;

\v 6 In the congregation of sinners will a fire be kindled;

\q1 Who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts. 
\q1
\v 11 Even if there be one stiff-necked person,

\q1 He is mighty to forgive, and he pours out wrath. 
\q1
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: 
\q1 He judges a man according to his works. 
\q1
\v 13 The sinner will not escape with \add his \add* plunder;

\v 9 There is a prosperity that a man finds in misfortunes;

\v 10 There is a gift that will not profit you;

\v 11 There is an abasement because of glory;

\v 12 There is that buys much for a little,

\v 13 He that is wise in words will make himself beloved;

\v 15 He will give little, and upbraid much;

\q1 Such an one is a hateful man. 
\q1
\v 16 The fool will say, I have no friend,

\v 22 There is that destroys his soul through bashfulness;

\q1
\v 23 There is that for bashfulness promises to his friend;

\b
\q1
\v 24 A lie is a foul blot in a man: 
\q1 It will be continually in the mouth of the ignorant. 
\q1
\v 25 A thief is better than a man that is continually lying:

\q1
\v 26 The disposition of a liar is dishonor;

\q1
\v 27 He that is wise in words will advance himself;

\q1
\v 29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise,

\v 30 Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is out of sight,

\q1
\v 3 All iniquity is as a two-edged sword; 
\q1 Its stroke has no healing.

\v 9 The congregation of wicked men is \add as \add* tow wrapped together;

\v 10 The way of sinners is made smooth with stones;

\q1
\v 11 He that keeps the law becomes master of the intent thereof;

\q1
\v 12 He that is not clever will not be instructed;

\v 13 The knowledge of a wise man will be made to abound as a flood;

\v 14 The inward parts of a fool are like a broken vessel;

\q1
\v 15 If a man of knowledge hear a wise word,

\q1
\v 16 The discourse of a fool is like a burden in the way; 
\q1 But grace will be found on the lips of the wise.

\v 17 The mouth of the prudent man will be sought for in the congregation;

\v 12 There is a manner of speech that is clothed about with death:

\v 13 Accustom not your mouth to gross rudeness,

\v 14 Remember your father and your mother,

\q1 Darkness is round about me, and the walls hide me,

\q1 The Most High will not remember my sins; 
\q1
\v 19 —And the eyes of men are his terror,

\v 21 This man will be punished in the streets of the city; 
\q1 And where he suspected not he will be taken. 
\q1
\v 22 So also a wife that leaves her husband, 
\q1 And brings in an heir by a stranger. 
\q1
\v 23 For first, she was disobedient in the law of the Most High; 
\q1 And secondly, she trespassed against her own husband; 
\q1 And thirdly, she played the adulteress in whoredom, 
\q1 And brought in children by a stranger. 
\q1
\v 24 She shall be brought out into the congregation; 
\q1 And upon her children will there be visitation. 
\q1
\v 25 Her children will not spread into roots, 
\q1 And her branches will bear no fruit. 
\q1
\v 26 She will leave her memory for a curse; 
\q1 And her reproach will not be blotted out.

\v 6 In the waves of the sea, and in all the earth, 
\q1 And in every people and nation, I got a possession. 
\q1
\v 7 With all these I sought rest; 
\q1 And in whose inheritance shall I lodge? 
\q1
\v 8 Then the Creator of all things gave me a commandment; 
\q1 And he that created me made my tabernacle to rest, 
\q1 And said, Let your tabernacle be in Jacob, 
\q1 And your inheritance in Israel. 
\q1
\v 9 He created me from the beginning before the world;

\v 10 In the holy tabernacle I ministered before him; 
\q1 And so was I established in Sion. 
\q1
\v 11 In the beloved city likewise he gave me rest; 
\q1 And in Jerusalem was my authority. 
\q1
\v 12 And I took root in a people that was glorified, 
\q1 Even in the portion of the Lord’s own inheritance. 
\q1
\v 13 I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, 
\q1 And as a cypress tree on the mountains of Hermon. 
\q1
\v 14 I was exalted like a palm tree on the sea shore,

\q1
\v 22 He that obeys me will not be ashamed;

\q1
\v 2 But three sorts \add of men \add* my soul hates, 
\q1 And I am greatly offended at their life:

\q1
\v 8 Happy is he that dwells with a wife of understanding; 
\q1 And he that has not slipped with his tongue; 
\q1 And he that has not served a man that is unworthy of him: 
\q1
\v 9 Happy is he that has found prudence; 
\q1 And he that speaks in the ears of those who listen. 
\q1
\v 10 How great is he that has found wisdom! 
\q1 Yet is there none above him that fears the Lord.

\q1
\v 15 There is no head above the head of a serpent; 
\q1 And there is no wrath above the wrath of an enemy. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 I will rather dwell with a lion and a dragon, 
\q1 Than keep house with a wicked woman. 
\q1
\v 17 The wickedness of a woman changes her look, 
\q1 And darkens her countenance as a bear does. 
\q1
\v 18 Her husband will sit at meat among his neighbors, 
\q1 And when he hears it he sighs bitterly. 
\q1

\q1
\v 3 Speak, you that are the elder, for it becomes you, \add but \add* with sound knowledge; 
\q1 And hinder not music. 
\q1
\v 4 Pour not out talk where there is a performance of music, 
\q1 And display not your wisdom out of season.

\v 5  \add As \add* a signet of carbuncle in a setting of gold,

\v 7 Speak, young man, if there be need of you;

\v 8 Sum up your speech, many things in few words;

\q1
\v 9  \add If you be \add* among great men, behave not as their equal;

\v 10 Lightning speeds before thunder;

\q1
\v 11 Rise up betimes, and be not the last;

\q1
\v 12 There take your pastime, and do what is in your heart; 
\q1 And sin not by proud speech: 
\q1
\v 13 And for these things bless him that made you,

\q1
\v 14 He that fears the Lord will receive \add his \add* discipline;

\q1
\v 15 He that seeks the law shall be filled therewith: 
\q1 But the hypocrite shall stumble thereat. 
\q1
\v 16 They that fear the Lord shall find judgement, 
\q1 And shall kindle righteous acts as a light. 
\q1
\v 17 A sinful man shuns reproof, 
\q1 And will find a judgement according to his will. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 A man of counsel will not neglect a thought; 
\q1 A strange and proud man will not crouch in fear, 
\q1 Even after he has done a thing by himself without counsel. 
\q1
\v 19 Do nothing without counsel; 
\q1 And when you have once done, repent not. 
\q1
\v 20 Go not in a way of conflict;

\v 21 Be not confident in a \f + \fr 32:21  \ft Gr. \fqa without stumbling blocks.\f* smooth way. 
\q1
\v 22 And beware of your own children. 
\q1
\v 23 In every work trust your own soul; 
\q1 For this is the keeping of the commandments.

\q1
\v 24 He that believes the law gives heed to the commandment; 
\q1 And he that trusts in the Lord shall suffer no loss. 
\c 33  
\q1
\v 1 There shall no evil happen to him that fears the Lord; 
\q1 But in temptation once and again he will deliver him. 
\q1
\v 2 A wise man will not hate the law; 
\q1 But he that is a hypocrite therein is as a ship in a storm. 
\q1
\v 3 A man of understanding will put his trust in the law; 
\q1 And the law is faithful to him, as when one asks at the oracle. 
\b
\q1
\v 4 Prepare \add your \add* speech, and so shall you be heard;

\v 5 The heart of a fool is \add as \add* a cartwheel;

\q1
\v 6 A stallion horse is as a mocking friend; 
\q1 He neighs under every one that sits upon him. 
\b
\q1
\v 7 Why does one day excel another, 
\q1 When all the light of every day in the year is of the sun? 
\q1
\v 8 By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished; 
\q1 And he varied seasons and feasts: 
\q1
\v 9 Some of them he exalted and hallowed, 
\q1 And some of them has he made ordinary days. 
\q1
\v 10 And all men are from the ground, 
\q1 And Adam was created of earth. 
\q1
\v 11 In the abundance of his knowledge the Lord distinguished them, 
\q1 And made their ways various: 
\q1
\v 12 Some of them he blessed and exalted, 
\q1 And some of them he hallowed and brought near to himself: 
\q1 Some of them he cursed and brought low, 
\q1 And overthrew them from their place. 
\q1
\v 13 As the clay of the potter in his hand, 
\q1 All his ways are according to his good pleasure; 
\q1 So men are in the hand of him that made them, 
\q1 To render to them according to his judgement. 
\q1
\v 14 Good is the opposite of evil, 
\q1 And life is the opposite of death: 
\q1 So is \f + \fr 33:14  \ft A line of this verse is here omitted by the best authorities. \f* the sinner is the opposite of the godly. 
\q1
\v 15 And thus look upon all the works of the Most High; 
\q1 Two and two, one against another. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 And I waked up last, 
\q1 As one that gleans after the grape gatherers: 
\q1 By the blessing of the Lord I got before them, 
\q1 And filled my winepress as one that gathers grapes. 
\q1
\v 17 Consider that I labored not for myself alone, 
\q1 But for all those who seek instruction. 
\q1
\v 18 Hear me, you° great men of the people, 
\q1 And listen with your ears, you° rulers of the congregation. 
\b
\q1
\v 19 To son and wife, to brother and friend, 
\q1 Give not power over you while you live; 
\q1 And give not your goods to another, 
\q1 Lest you repent and make supplication for them \add again. \add* 
\q1
\v 20 Whilst you yet live, and breath is in you, 
\q1 Give not yourself over to anybody. 
\q1
\v 21 For better it is that your children should supplicate you, 
\q1 Than that you should look to the hand of your sons. 
\q1
\v 22 In all your works keep the upper hand; 
\q1 Bring not a stain on your honor. 
\q1
\v 23 In the day that you endest the days of your life, 
\q1 And in the time of death, distribute your inheritance. 
\b
\q1
\v 24 Fodder, a stick, and burdens, for an ass; 
\q1 Bread, and discipline, and work, for a servant. 
\q1
\v 25 Set your servant to work, and you shall find rest: 
\q1 Leave his hands idle, and he will seek liberty. 
\q1
\v 26 Yoke and thong will bow the neck: 
\q1 And for an evil servant there are racks and tortures. 
\q1
\v 27 Send him to labor, that he be not idle; 
\q1 For idleness teaches much mischief. 
\q1
\v 28 Set him to work, as is fit for him; 
\q1 And if he obey not, make his fetters heavy. 
\q1
\v 29 And be not excessive toward any; 
\q1 And without judgement do nothing. 
\b
\q1
\v 30 If you have a servant, let him be as yourself, 
\q1 Because you have bought him with blood. 
\q1
\v 31 If you have a servant, treat him as yourself; 
\q1 \f + \fr 33:31  \ft The Greek text of this line is probably corrupt. \f* For as your own soul will you have need of him: 
\q1 If you treat him ill, and he depart and run away, 
\q1 Which way will you go to seek him? 
\b
\c  34  
\q1
\v 1 Vain and false hopes are for a man void of understanding; 
\q1 And dreams give wings to fools. 
\q1
\v 2 As one that catches at a shadow, and follows after the wind, 
\q1 So is he that sets his mind on dreams. 
\q1
\v 3 The vision of dreams is \add as \add* this thing against that, 
\q1 The likeness of a face near a face. 
\q1
\v 4 Of an unclean thing what shall be cleansed? 
\q1 And of that which is false what shall be true? 
\q1
\v 5 Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: 
\q1 And the heart fancies, as a woman’s in travail. 
\q1
\v 6 If they be not sent from the Most High in \add your \add* visitation, 
\q1 Give not your heart to them. 
\v 7 For dreams have led many astray: 
\q1 And they have failed by putting their hope in them. 
\q1
\v 8 Without lying shall the law be accomplished; 
\q1 And wisdom is perfection to a faithful mouth. 
\b
\q1
\v 9 A well-instructed man knows many things; 
\q1 And he that has much experience will declare understanding. 
\q1
\v 10 He that has no experience knows few things: 
\q1 But he that has wandered shall increase \add his \add* skill. 
\q1
\v 11 In my wandering I have seen many things; 
\q1 And more than my words is my understanding. 
\q1
\v 12 Ofttimes was I in danger even to death; 
\q1 And I was preserved because of these things. 
\q1
\v 13 The spirit of those that fear the Lord shall live; 
\q1 For their hope is upon him that saves them. 
\q1
\v 14 Whoso fears the Lord shall not be afraid, and shall not play the coward; 
\q1 For he is his hope. 
\q1
\v 15 Blessed is the soul of him that fears the Lord: 
\q1 To whom does he give heed? and who is his stay? 
\q1
\v 16 The eyes of the Lord are upon those who love him, 
\q1 A mighty protection and strong stay, 
\q1 A cover from the hot blast, and a cover from the noonday, 
\q1 A guard from stumbling, and a help from falling. 
\q1
\v 17 He raises up the soul, and enlightens the eyes: 
\q1 He gives healing, life, and blessing. 
\b
\q1
\v 18 He that sacrifices of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is made in mockery; 
\q1 And the mockeries of wicked men are not well-pleasing. 
\q1
\v 19 The Most High has no pleasure in the offerings of the ungodly; 
\q1 Neither is he pacified for sins by the multitude of sacrifices. 
\q1
\v 20  \add As \add* one that kills the son before his father’s eyes 
\q1 Is he that brings a sacrifice from the goods of the poor. 
\q1
\v 21 The bread of the needy is the life of the poor: 
\q1 He that deprives him thereof is a man of blood. 
\q1
\v 22  \add As \add* one that slays his neighbor is he that takes away his living; 
\q1 And \add as \add* a shedder of blood is he that deprives a hireling of his hire. 
\q1
\v 23 One building, and another pulling down, 
\q1 What profit have they had but toil? 
\q1
\v 24 One praying, and another cursing, 
\q1 Whose voice will the Lord listen to? 
\q1
\v 25 He that washes himself after \add touching \add* a dead body, and touches it again, 
\q1 What profit has he in his washing? 
\q1
\v 26 Even so a man fasting for his sins, 
\q1 And going again, and doing the same; 
\q1 Who will listen to his prayer? 
\q1 And what profit has he in his humiliation? 
\b
\c  35  
\q1
\v 1 He that keeps the law multiplies offerings; 
\q1 He that takes heed to the commandments sacrifices a peace offering. 
\q1
\v 2 He that requites a good turn offers fine flour; 
\q1 And he that gives alms sacrifices a thank offering. 
\q1
\v 3 To depart from wickedness is a thing pleasing to the Lord; 
\q1 And to depart from unrighteousness is an atoning sacrifice. 
\q1
\v 4 See that you appear not in the presence of the Lord empty. 
\q1
\v 5 For all these things \add are to be done \add* because of the commandment. 
\q1
\v 6 The offering of the righteous makes the altar fat; 
\q1 And the sweet savor thereof \add is \add* before the Most High. 
\q1
\v 7 The sacrifice of a righteous man is acceptable; 
\q1 And the memorial thereof shall not be forgotten.

\v 8 Glorify the Lord with a good eye,

\v 9 In every gift show a cheerful countenance,

\v 11 For the Lord recompenses,

\b
\q1
\v 12 Think not to corrupt with gifts; for he will not receive them: 
\q1 And set not your mind on an unrighteous sacrifice; 
\q1 For the Lord is judge, 
\q1 And with him is no respect of persons. 
\q1
\v 13 He will not accept any person against a poor man; 
\q1 And he will listen to the prayer of him that is wronged. 
\q1
\v 14 He will in no wise despise the supplication of the fatherless; 
\q1 Nor the widow, \f + \fr 35:14  \ft Gr. \fqa if \f* when she pours out her tale.

\v 15 Do not the tears of the widow run down her cheek?

\v 16 He that serves \add God \add* according to his good pleasure shall be accepted, 
\q1 And his supplication shall reach to the clouds. 
\q1
\v 17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds; 
\q1 And till it come near, he will not be comforted; 
\q1 And he will not depart, till the Most High shall visit; 
\q1 And he shall judge \f + \fr 35:17  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa for the righteous. \f* righteously, and execute judgement. 
\q1
\v 18 And the Lord will not be slack, neither will he be patient toward them,

\v 19 Till he have rendered to \add every \add* man according to his doings, 
\q1 And \add to \add* the works of men according to their plans;

\v 21 A woman will receive any man;

\v 22 The beauty of a woman cheers the countenance;

\q1
\v 4 There is a companion, which rejoices in the gladness of a friend,

\v 29 Be not insatiable in any luxury,

\v 3 The skill of the physician shall lift up his head;

\v 4 The Lord created medicines out of the earth;

\q1
\v 5 Was not water made sweet with wood,

\q1
\v 11 Give a sweet savor, and a memorial of fine flour; 
\q1 And make fat your offering, as one that is not. 
\q1
\v 12 Then give place to the physician, for truly the Lord has created him; 
\q1 And let him not go from you, for you have need of him. 
\q1
\v 13 There is a time when in their very hands is the issue for good. 
\q1
\v 14 For they also shall beseech the Lord, 
\q1 That he may prosper them in \add giving \add* relief and in healing for the maintenance of life. 
\q1
\v 15 He that sins before his Maker, 
\q1 Let him fall into the hands of the physician. 
\b
\q1
\v 16 My son, let your tears fall over the dead, 
\q1 And as one that suffers grievously begin lamentation; 
\q1 And wind up his body according to his due, 
\q1 And neglect not his burial. 
\q1
\v 17 Make bitter weeping, and make passionate wailing, 
\q1 And let your mourning be according to his desert, 
\q1 For one day or two, lest you be evil spoken of: 
\q1 And so be comforted for your sorrow. 
\q1
\v 18 For of sorrow comes death, 
\q1 And sorrow of heart will bow down the strength.

\v 25 How shall he become wise that holds the plow,

\q1 And whose discourse is of the stock of bulls? 
\q1
\v 26 He will set his heart upon turning his furrows;

\q1
\v 27 So is every craftsman and workmaster,

\q1 They that cut gravings of signets, 
\q1 And his diligence is to make great variety;

\v 28 So is the smith sitting by the anvil,

\v 29 So is the potter sitting at his work,

\v 2 He will keep the discourse of the men of renown,

\v 3 He will seek out the hidden meaning of proverbs,

\q1
\v 4 He will serve among great men, 
\q1 And appear before him that rules: 
\q1 He will travel through the land of strange nations;

\q1
\v 5 He will apply his heart to return early to the Lord that made him,

\v 20 Who kept the law of the Most High,

\v 16 He chose him out of all living

\q1 To make reconciliation for your people. 
\q1
\v 17 He gave to him in his commandments,

\q1
\v 18 Strangers gathered themselves together against him,

\v 20 And he added glory to Aaron,

\v 21 For they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord,

\q1 For the Lord himself brought his enemies to him. 
\q1
\v 4 Did not the sun go back by his hand? 
\q1 And didn’t one day become as two? 
\q1
\v 5 He called upon the Most High \add and \add* Mighty One,

\v 6 With hailstones of mighty power 
\q1 He caused war to break violently upon the nation,

\v 7 Also in the time of Moses he did a work of mercy,

\q1 In that they withstood the adversary, 
\q1 Hindered the people from sin, 
\q1 And stilled the murmuring of wickedness. 
\q1
\v 8 And of six hundred thousand people on foot, they two alone were preserved 
\q1 To bring them into the heritage,

\v 9 Also the Lord gave strength to Caleb,

\v 10 That all the children of Israel might see

\v 13 Samuel, the prophet of the Lord, beloved of his Lord,

\q1
\v 14 By the law of the Lord he judged the congregation, 
\q1 And the Lord visited Jacob. 
\q1
\v 15 By his faithfulness he was proved to be a prophet, 
\q1 And by his words he was known to be faithful in vision. 
\q1
\v 16 Also when his enemies pressed him round about 
\q1 He called upon the Lord, the Mighty One, 
\q1 With the offering of the sucking lamb. 
\q1
\v 17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, 
\q1 And with a mighty sound made his voice to be heard. 
\q1
\v 18 And he utterly destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians,

\q1
\v 19 Also before the time of his \f + \fr 46:19  \ft Gr. \fqa age-long sleep. \f* long sleep 
\q1 He made protestations in the sight of the lord and \add his \add* anointed, 
\q1 I have not taken any man’s goods, so much as a sandal: 
\q1 And no man did accuse him. 
\q1
\v 20 And after he fell asleep he prophesied, 
\q1 And showed the king his end, 
\q1 And lifted up his voice from the earth in prophecy, 
\q1 To blot out the wickedness of the people. 
\b
\c  47  
\q1
\v 1 And after him rose up Nathan 
\q1 To prophesy in the days of David. 
\q1
\v 2 As is the fat when it is separated from the peace offering, 
\q1 So was David \add separated \add* from the children of Israel. 
\q1
\v 3 He played with lions as with kids, 
\q1 And with bears as with lambs of the flock. 
\q1
\v 4 In his youth did he not kill a giant, 
\q1 And take away reproach from the people, 
\q1 When he lifted up his hand with a sling stone, 
\q1 And beat down the boasting of Goliath? 
\q1
\v 5 For he called upon the Most High Lord; 
\q1 And he gave him strength in his right hand, 
\q1 To kill a man mighty in war, 
\q1 To exalt the horn of his people. 
\q1
\v 6 So they glorified him for \add his \add* ten thousands, 
\q1 And praised him for the blessings of the Lord, 
\q1 In that there was given him a diadem of glory. 
\q1
\v 7 For he destroyed the enemies on every side, 
\q1 And brought to nothing the Philistines his adversaries, 
\q1 Brake their horn in pieces to this day. 
\q1
\v 8 In every work of his he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High with words of glory; 
\q1 With his whole heart he sang praise, 
\q1 And loved him that made him. 
\q1
\v 9 Also he set singers before the altar, 
\q1 And to make sweet melody by their music. \f + \fr 47:9  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f* 
\q1
\v 10 He gave beauty to the feasts,

\q1 While they praised his holy name, 
\q1 And the sanctuary sounded from early morning. 
\q1
\v 11 The Lord took away his sins, 
\q1 And exalted his horn forever; 
\q1 And gave him a covenant of kings, 
\q1 And a throne of glory in Israel. 
\q1
\v 12 After him rose up a son, a man of understanding; 
\q1 And for his sake he lived at large. 
\q1
\v 13 Solomon reigned in days of peace;

\q1
\v 14 How wise was you made in your youth, 
\q1 And filled as a river with understanding!

\q1 And for your interpretations, the countries marveled at you. 
\q1
\v 18 By the name of the Lord God, 
\q1 Which is called the God of Israel, 
\q1 You did gather gold as tin, 
\q1 And did multiply silver as lead. 
\q1
\v 19 You did bow your loins to women, 
\q1 And in your body you were brought into subjection. 
\q1
\v 20 You did blemish your honor, 
\q1 And profane your seed, 
\q1 To bring wrath upon your children; 
\q1 And I was grieved for your folly: 
\q1
\v 21 So that the sovereignty was divided, 
\q1 And out of Ephraim ruled a disobedient kingdom. 
\q1
\v 22 But the Lord will never forsake his mercy; 
\q1 And he will not destroy any of his works, 
\q1 Nor blot out the posterity of his elect; 
\q1 And the seed of him that loved him he will not take away; 
\q1 And he gave a remnant to Jacob, 
\q1 And to David a root out of him. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 And \add so \add* rested Solomon with his fathers; 
\q1 And of his seed he left behind him Rehoboam, 
\q1 \add Even \add* the foolishness of the people, and one that lacked understanding, 
\q1 Who made the people to revolt by his counsel. 
\q1 Also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, 
\q1 Who made Israel to sin, 
\q1 And gave to Ephraim a way of sin. 
\q1
\v 24 And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, 
\q1 To remove them from their land. 
\q1
\v 25 For they sought out all manner of wickedness, 
\q1 Till vengeance should come upon them. 
\b
\c  48  
\q1
\v 1 Also there arose Elijah the prophet as fire, 
\q1 And his word burned like a torch: 
\q1
\v 2 Who brought a famine upon them, 
\q1 And by his zeal made them few in number. 
\q1
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven: 
\q1 Thrice did he thus bring down fire. 
\q1
\v 4 How was you glorified, O Elijah, in your wondrous deeds! 
\q1 And who shall glory like to you?

\v 7 Who heard rebuke in Sinai, 
\q1 And judgments of vengeance in Horeb: 
\q1
\v 8 Who anointed kings for retribution, 
\q1 And prophets to succeed after him: 
\q1
\v 9 Who was taken up in a tempest of fire, 
\q1 In a chariot of fiery horses: 
\q1
\v 10 Who was recorded for reproofs in their seasons, 
\q1 To pacify anger, before it brake forth into wrath; 
\q1 To turn the heart of the father to the son, 
\q1 And to restore the tribes of Jacob. 
\q1
\v 11 Blessed are those who saw you, 
\q1 And those who have been beautified with love; 
\q1 For we also shall surely live.

\q1
\v 12 Elijah \add it was, \add* who was wrapped in a tempest:

\v 14 As in his life he did wonders, 
\q1 So in death were his works marvelous. 
\q1
\v 15 For all this the people repented not, 
\q1 And they departed not from their sins, 
\q1 Till they were carried away as a plunder from their land, 
\q1 And were scattered through all the earth; 
\q1 And the people was left very few in number, 
\q1 And a ruler \add was left \add* in the house of David. 
\q1
\v 16 Some of them did that which was pleasing \add to God, \add*

\v 17 Hezekiah fortified his city,

\q1
\v 18 In his days Sennacherib came up, 
\q1 And sent Rabshakeh, and departed; 
\q1 And he lifted up his hand against Sion, 
\q1 And boasted great things in his arrogance. 
\q1
\v 19 Then were their hearts and their hands shaken, 
\q1 And they were in pain, as women in travail; 
\q1
\v 20 And they called upon the Lord which is merciful, 
\q1 Spreading forth their hands to him: 
\q1 And the Holy One heard them speedily out of Heaven, 
\q1 And delivered them by the hand of Isaiah. 
\q1
\v 21 He struck the camp of the Assyrians, 
\q1 And his angel utterly destroyed them. 
\q1
\v 22 For Hezekiah did that which was pleasing to the Lord, 
\q1 And was strong in the ways of David his father, 
\q1 Which Isaiah the prophet commanded, 
\q1 Who was great and faithful in his vision. 
\q1
\v 23 In his days the sun went backward; 
\q1 And he added life to the king. 
\q1
\v 24 He saw by an excellent spirit what should come to pass at the last; 
\q1 And he comforted those who mourned in Sion. 
\q1
\v 25 He showed the things that should be to the end of time, 
\q1 And the hidden things or ever they came.

\v 1 The memorial of Josiah is like the composition of incense

\q1
\v 2 He behaved himself uprightly in the conversion of the people,

\q1
\v 4 Except David and Hezekiah and Josiah, 
\q1 All committed trespass: 
\q1 For they forsook the law of the Most High;

\v 5 For they gave their \f + \fr 49:5  \ft Gr. \fqa horn. \f* power to others,

\q1
\v 6 They set on fire the chosen city of the sanctuary,

\v 12 So was Jesus the son of Josedek: 
\q1 Who in their days built the house, 
\q1 And exalted a \f + \fr 49:12  \ft Some ancient authorities read \fqa temple. \f* people holy to the Lord, 
\q1 Prepared for everlasting glory. 
\q1
\v 13 Also of Nehemiah the memorial is great; 
\q1 Who raised up for us the walls that were fallen, 
\q1 And set up the gates and bars, 
\q1 And raised up our homes again. 
\b
\q1
\v 14 No man was created upon the earth such as was Enoch; 
\q1 For he was taken up from the earth. 
\q1
\v 15 Neither was there a man born like to Joseph, 
\q1 A governor of his kindred, a stay of the people: 
\q1 Yes, his bones were visited. 
\q1
\v 16 Shem and Seth were glorified among men; 
\q1 And above every living thing in the creation is Adam.

\q1
\v 1  \add It was \add* Simon, the son of Onias, the \f + \fr 50:1  \ft Or, \fqa high \f* great priest, 
\q1 Who in his life repaired the house, 
\q1 And in his days strengthened the temple: 
\q1
\v 2 And by him was built from the foundation the height of the double \add wall, \add* 
\q1 The lofty underworks of the inclosure of the temple: 
\q1
\v 3 In his days the cistern of waters was \f + \fr 50:3  \ft The text here seems to be corrupt. \f* diminished, 
\q1 The brazen vessel in compass as the sea. 
\q1
\v 4  \add It was \add* he that took thought for his people that they should not fall, 
\q1 And fortified the city \f + \fr 50:4  \ft Gr. \fqa to beseige: \ft that is, \fqa as to besieging it. \f* against besieging: 
\q1
\v 5 How glorious was he when the people gathered round him 
\q1 At his coming forth out of the \f + \fr 50:5  \ft Gr. \fqa house of the veil. \f* sanctuary! 
\q1
\v 6 As the morning star in the midst of a cloud, 
\q1 As the moon at the full: 
\q1
\v 7 As the sun shining forth upon the temple of the Most High, 
\q1 And as the rainbow giving light in clouds of glory: 
\q1
\v 8 As the flower of roses in the days of new \add fruits, \add* 
\q1 As lilies at the water spring, 
\q1 As the shoot of the frankincense tree in the time of summer: 
\q1
\v 9 As fire and incense in the censer, 
\q1 As a vessel all of beaten gold 
\q1 Adorned with all manner of precious stones: 
\q1
\v 10 As an olive tree budding forth fruits, 
\q1 And as a cypress growing high among the clouds. 
\q1
\v 11 When he took up the robe of glory, 
\q1 And put on the perfection of exultation, 
\q1 In the ascent of the holy altar, 
\q1 He made glorious the precinct of the sanctuary. 
\q1
\v 12 And when he received the portions out of the priests’ hands, 
\q1 Himself also standing by the hearth of the altar, 
\q1 His kindred as a garland round about him, 
\q1 He was as a young cedar in Libanus; 
\q1 And as stems of palm trees compassed they him round about, 
\q1
\v 13 And all the sons of Aaron in their glory, 
\q1 And the Lord’s offering in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel. 
\q1
\v 14 And finishing the service at the altars, 
\q1 That he might adorn the offering of the Most High, the Almighty, 
\q1
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the \f + \fr 50:15  \ft Gr. \fqa cup of libation. \f* cup, 
\q1 And poured out the cup of the grape; 
\q1 He poured out at the foot of the altar 
\q1 A sweet smelling savor to the Most High, the King of all. 
\q1
\v 16 Then shouted the sons of Aaron, 
\q1 They sounded the trumpets of beaten work, 
\q1 They made a great noise to be heard, 
\q1 For a remembrance before the Most High. 
\q1
\v 17 Then all the people together hurried, 
\q1 And fell down upon the earth on their faces 
\q1 To worship their Lord, the Almighty, God Most High. 
\q1
\v 18 The singers also praised him with their voices; 
\q1 In the whole house was there made sweet melody. 
\q1
\v 19 And the people implored the Lord Most High, 
\q1 In prayer before him that is merciful. 
\q1 Till the \f + \fr 50:19  \ft Gr. \fqa adornment. \f* worship of the Lord should be ended; 
\q1 And so they accomplished his service. 
\q1
\v 20 Then he went down, and lifted up his hands 
\q1 Over the whole congregation of the children of Israel, 
\q1 To give blessing to the Lord with his lips, 
\q1 And to glory in his name. 
\q1
\v 21 And he bowed himself down in worship the second time, 
\q1 To declare the blessing from the Most High. 
\b
\q1
\v 22 And now bless you° the God of all, 
\q1 Which everywhere does great things, 
\q1 Which exalts our days from the womb, 
\q1 And deals with us according to his mercy. 
\q1
\v 23 May he grant us joyfulness of heart, 
\q1 And that peace may be in our days in Israel for the days of eternity: 
\q1
\v 24 To entrust his mercy with us; 
\q1 And let him deliver us in his time! 
\b
\q1
\v 25 With two nations is my soul vexed, 
\q1 And the third is no nation: 
\q1
\v 26 They that sit upon the mountain of \f + \fr 50:26  \ft According to some ancient versions, \fqa Seir. \f* Samaria, \add and \add* the Philistines, 
\q1 And that foolish people that dwells in Sichem.

\q1
\v 27 I have \f + \fr 50:27  \ft Gr. \fqa graven. \f* written in this book the instruction of understanding and knowledge, 
\q1 I Jesus, the son of Sirach Eleazar, of Jerusalem, 
\q1 Who out of his heart poured forth wisdom. 
\q1
\v 28 Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things; 
\q1 And he that lays them up in his heart shall become wise. 
\q1
\v 29 For if he do them, he shall be strong to all things: 
\q1 For the light of the Lord is his \f + \fr 50:29  \ft Gr. \fqa footstep. \f* guide. \f + \fr 50:29  \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f*

\p A Prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. 
\q1
\v 1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, O King, 
\q1 And will praise you, O God my Savior: 
\q1 I do give thanks to your name: 
\q1
\v 2 For you were my protector and helper, 
\q1 And did deliver my body out of destruction, 
\q1 And out of the snare of a slanderous tongue, 
\q1 From lips that forge lies, 
\q1 And was my helper before those who stood by; 
\q1
\v 3 And did deliver me, according to the abundance of your mercy, and \add greatness \add* of your name, 
\q1 From the gnashings \add of teeth \add* ready to devour, 
\q1 Out of the hand of such as sought my life, 
\q1 Out of the manifold afflictions which I had; 
\q1
\v 4 From the choking of a fire on every side, 
\q1 And out of the midst of fire which I kindled not; 
\q1
\v 5 Out of the depth of the belly of \f + \fr 51:5  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades. \f* the grave, 
\q1 And from an unclean tongue, 
\q1 And from lying words, 
\q1
\v 6 The slander of an unrighteous tongue to the king. 
\q1 My soul drew near even to death, 
\q1 And my life was near to \f + \fr 51:6  \ft Gr. \fqa Hades \f* the grave beneath. 
\q1
\v 7 They compassed me on every side, 
\q1 And there was none to help \add me. \add* 
\q1 \add I was \add* looking for the help of men, 
\q1 And it was not. 
\q1
\v 8 And I remembered your mercy, O Lord, 
\q1 And your working which has been from everlasting, 
\q1 How you deliver those who wait for you, 
\q1 And save them out of the hand of the enemies. 
\q1
\v 9 And I lifted up my supplication from the earth, 
\q1 And prayed for deliverance from death. 
\q1
\v 10 I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, 
\q1 That he would not forsake me in the days of affliction, 
\q1 In the time when there was no help against the proud. 
\q1
\v 11 I will praise your name continually, 
\q1 And will sing praise with thanksgiving; 
\q1 And my supplication was heard: 
\q1
\v 12 For you saved me from destruction, 
\q1 And delivered me from the evil time: 
\q1 Therefore I will give thanks and praise to you, 
\q1 And bless the name of the Lord. 
\b
\q1
\v 13 When I was yet young, 
\q1 Or ever I went abroad, 
\q1 I sought wisdom openly in my prayer. 
\q1
\v 14 Before the temple I asked for her, 
\q1 And I will seek her out even to the end. 
\q1
\v 15 From \add her \add* flower as from the ripening grape my heart delighted in her: 
\q1 My foot trod in uprightness, 
\q1 From my youth I tracked her out. 
\q1
\v 16 I bowed down my ear a little, and received her, 
\q1 And found for myself much instruction. 
\q1
\v 17 I profited in her: 
\q1 To him that gives me wisdom I will give glory. 
\q1
\v 18 For I purposed to practice her, 
\q1 And I was zealous for that which is good; 
\q1 And I shall never be put to shame. 
\q1
\v 19 My soul has wrestled in her, 
\q1 And in my doing I was exact: 
\q1 I spread forth my hands to the heaven above, 
\q1 And bewailed my ignorances of her. 
\q1
\v 20 I set my soul aright to her, 
\q1 And in pureness I found her. 
\q1 I got me a heart \add joined \add* with her from the beginning: 
\q1 Therefore shall I not be forsaken. 
\q1
\v 21 My inward part also was troubled to seek her: 
\q1 Therefore I have gotten a good possession. 
\q1
\v 22 The Lord gave me a tongue for my reward; 
\q1 And I will praise him therewith. 
\b
\q1
\v 23 Draw near to me, you° unlearned, 
\q1 And lodge in the house of instruction. 
\q1
\v 24 Say, wherefore are you° lacking in these things, 
\q1 And your souls are very thirsty? 
\q1
\v 25 I opened my mouth, and spoke, 
\q1 Get her for yourselves without money. 
\q1
\v 26 Put your neck under the yoke, 
\q1 And let your soul receive instruction: 
\q1 She is hard at hand to find. 
\q1
\v 27 Behold with your eyes, 
\q1 How that I labored but a little, 
\q1 And found for myself much rest. 
\q1
\v 28 Get you instruction with a great sum of silver, 
\q1 And gain much gold by her. 
\q1
\v 29 May your soul rejoice in his mercy, 
\q1 And may you° not be put to shame in praising him. 
\q1
\v 30 Work your work before the time comes, 
\q1 And in his time he will give you your reward.
