The ETCBC4 project provides a Hebrew morphology with English glosses.
The ETCBC4 database is in the public domain.
It contains a lot of useful information, but it also lacks information useful to Bible translators.

Download the raw html data through the Debug page.
The progress will be visible in the Journal.
It takes more than 10 hours.
After finished, browse through the Journal to look for any download errors.
Download once more to more clearly see any errors that might have occurred in the previous download.

Check the total verse count:
sqlite> select count(*) from rawdata;
23213

Via de Debug page, parse the database.
After parsing it:
DROP TABLE rawdata;
VACUUM;

Convert all Hebrew characters to the NFC format.
The following link explains the reason for this:
https://github.com/bibledit/cloud/issues/252
$ echo .dump | sqlite3 etcb4.sqlite > one.sql
$ ls -lh *.sql
$ uconv -x any-nfc -o two.sql one.sql
$ ls -l *.sql
$ rm etcb4.sqlite
$ cat two.sql | sqlite3 etcb4.sqlite
$ rm one.sql two.sql

Then copy the database "etcb4.sqlite" into folder "databases" in the source tree.
