Bibledit Cloud Configuration


All configuration files reside in the config folder.


When Bibledit Cloud runs behind a proxy server, Bibledit is not able to find out its own URL that faces the user.
The user-facing URL can be set through a configuration file.
The name of the configuration file is: userfacingurl.conf
It contains the URL, for example: https://bibledit.org:1500/
An example configuration file is included: userfacingurl.txt


The secure http server needs a key and public certificates.
We are going to use certificates issued by Let's Encrypt.
We are going to use Certbot for obtaining and maintaining certificates.
Documentation is https://certbot.eff.org/docs/

The first step is to obtain the certificates.
Run the following as root:
$ certbot certonly
Follow the screen to request the initial certificates.
If successful, the certificates will be stored in this folder:
/etc/letsencrypt/live/yoursite.org

Then once every month or so, renew the certificates.
Run the following as root:
$ certbot renew

After requesting and after renewing the certificates, copy them into place.
Run the following as root:
$ cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yoursite.org/*.pem /var/bibledit/bibledit-cloud/config
The configuration path in this example is at /var/bibledit/bibledit-cloud/config.
The path for your Bibledit Cloud instances is available from menu Help / Installation.

After the certificates have been copied, restart Bibledit Cloud. It will then load the new certificates.


To enforce secure http for browser communications, put a file named browser.https in the config folder.
The file may be empty. Once this file is found, Bibledit Cloud will redirect any incoming http browser traffic to https traffic.
A file with the name of client.https will do the same for Bibledit client traffic.


OpenLDAP server: See file ldap.txt for more information.


Network port for http server:
The default value is 8080.
Put a different port number in file "network-port".
The port number entered here is for the plain http.


Network port for the https server:
By default the port number or secure http, https, is the plain port number plus one.
So the default port number for https is 8081.
Put a different port number in file "network-port-secure".
If the file contains a "0", Bibledit won't run its embedded https server.


Administrator details: To preset the administrator's account, put the details in the files "admin-username" and "admin-password" and "admin-email", one detail per file.


Demo installation: If the file config/demo is present, it behaves as a demo installation.


Obfuscating the user interface: See folder obfuscate for more information.


Indonesian Cloud Free: If the file config/indonesiancloudfree is present, the Cloud modifies its behaviour in several places, so it can be used as a free Indonesian Bibledit Cloud.


After making a change in the configuration, restart Bibledit Cloud, for the new configuration to take effect.


Logging all network connections.
To enable this, put a file "log-network" in the config folder. The file can be left empty.
If this file is there, Bibledit will log information to file tmp/log-network.csv".
